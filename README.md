# DriverPass_design
## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client for the DriverPass Project is a company called DriverPass.  The intended system they requested was a system in which their customers would have a platform by which to aid them in attaining their driver's learning permit and licences.  They would accomplish this by offering study materials for the written tests and arranging driving lessons with cars and driving instructors, all arranged through the platform.
## What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I believe that I clearly established the functional and non-functional requirements very well. 
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the UML diagrams could use the most revision, upon further inspection they need additional details to clarify the design further. 
## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by considering what actions would be needed to satisfy their needs.  Those actions then formed the basis of the functional requirements for the system.  It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because if the user's needs are not met by the system, then the system is a failure.  
## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by first defining what the need of the software is, then attempting to satisfy all the needs.  The various tools and architecture required by the design would depend greatly on what the software needs to accomplish, to it is often a good idea to break down what each step in the system needs to accomplish and continously check to see if each of those steps gets us closer to meeting that need.
